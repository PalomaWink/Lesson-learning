# Project-Trybe
<strong>Developed on 01/27 and with the following objectives:</strong><br>
"You'll develop a website that contains a wealth of information about what you've learned here at Trybe over the past three blocks. Your site must have positioned and styled elements and, in addition, must contain appropriate semantics to be accessible and better ranked."
